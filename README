Point and Click Adventure Game Player

Description
-----------

This is a very early days Point and Click Adventure Game Player for 
the Commodore Amiga.

You've heard of ScummVM right?
------------------------------

Yes, and ScummVM has been ported to the Amiga. This is different,
in a few ways:-

* We don't use any ScummVM code.
* This is written directly for the Amiga, using the Amiga hardware and 
  software directly.

Can my Amiga play it?
---------------------

Probably. Our minimum requirement for a playable Maniac Mansion is an ECS 
Amiga, running Workbench 2.

Can I play "Insert Game Here"
-----------------------------

Not yet. Current focus is to get Parrot to play Maniac Mansion. It is the 
grand-daddy of "Point and Click's" and we have to start somewhere.

What language are you writing this in?
--------------------------------------

It is C++, using the GCC compiler. 
Assembly may be used to "tighten up those graphics on Level 3"

Why the name Parrot?
--------------------

It's a reference in Monkey Island 2. You've probably never heard of it, and
its better name than a bodily fluid.

Is this Free?
-------------

Free and Open Source (GPL3).

What are the System Requirements?
---------------------------------

* Motorola 68k based Commodore Amiga running Amiga OS 3.0 or higher
* A harddrive is recommended
* Original Amiga copies of LucasArts Games:
** Maniac Mansion -- http://hol.abime.net/2405
